# Software-Development
class project

This project nicknamed ThePiHost is the finished product of Software Development class at CU Boulder as a Junior. 
My team and I created several games (pong and space defenders) and a packaged downloadable version of n64 games with a work emulator
for mac. We created a landing website to present a downloadable package with all the games. The website was hosted via my rasp pi 
configured as a local sever with a domain we signed up.
